# Phonepe_streamlit

Hi there! This repo contains an interactive Streamlit dashboard source code along with the PhonePe Pulse datasets. The aim is to break down user behavior, transaction trends, insurance adoption, and regional insights in a visual way.

**What is the dashboard about**

User Registration Analysis
Top states/districts/pincodes, growth trends over time, and engagement ratios.

Transaction Dynamics across state & district
Trends by payment category, state-wise patterns, and top-performing regions.

Insurance transaction, penetration & growth Insights
Insurance penetration, growth potential, intensity by region, and top contributing locations.

**How to run locally**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/phonepe_streamlit_dashboard.git
cd phonepe_streamlit_dashboard
streamlit run <dashboard_file.py>

Make sure the required CSV files are placed in the same folder or properly linked.
